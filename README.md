# Smart White-Cane using Arduino and assembly language
Around the world, there are at least 2.2 billion people in the world who are visually impaired
or near-visual impairment.
Generally, the people who are visually impaired usually use guide dogs, sighted guides and
white canes. Surprisingly, only 2-8% use the white cane in order to navigate through day-today life. With this project, we propose improvements to the white cane such as using ultrasonic
sensors, flame sensors and water sensors so as to provide a safer and more advanced white
cane.

**We propose an efficient system designed with a microcontroller that processes signals
and alerts the visually impaired person over any obstacle, water, fire or light-based
obstacles through buzzer sounds. The system consists of ultrasound, water, , flame sensor
and LDR for receiving, processing, and sending signals to the alarm system which finally
alerts the user for prompt action.**
